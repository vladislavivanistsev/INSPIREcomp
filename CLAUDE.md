# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Waldur Quest is a browser-based skill assessment game for Waldur developers. It uses the KAPLAY game engine (formerly Kaboom.js) to create an interactive quiz experience based on the Waldur Way skill system.

## Running the Project

No build step required. Serve via any static HTTP server:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in browser.

For GitHub Pages deployment, push to a gh-pages branch or enable Pages in repository settings.

## Architecture

### File Structure
- `index.html` - Entry point, loads KAPLAY from CDN and all JS files
- `js/main.js` - Game initialization and all KAPLAY scenes
- `js/data/skills.js` - Skill definitions (tiers, packages, weapon profiles)
- `js/data/questions.js` - Question bank organized by skill ID and difficulty level (560+ questions)
- `js/utils/storage.js` - LocalStorage persistence layer

### No Build System
The project uses vanilla JS with global variables (no ES modules) for GitHub Pages compatibility. Scripts must load in order: skills.js → questions.js → storage.js → main.js.

### KAPLAY Game Engine
- Initialized with `kaplay()` returning `k` instance
- Uses scene-based architecture: `menu`, `skillTree`, `skillDetail`, `quiz`, `results`, `profile`
- All text elements use `font: 'Inter'` loaded via `k.loadFont()`
- Scene transitions via `k.go('sceneName', { data })`
- Overlays (help, confirmations) use z-index layering with `k.z()`

**Text Escaping Rule:**
KAPLAY uses `[` and `]` for styled text markup. Any dynamic text or text containing square brackets must be escaped to avoid "unclosed tags" errors:
- Use the `escapeText()` helper function for dynamic content (questions, explanations, user input)
- For static text, use parentheses instead: `(1) Start Quest` not `[1] Start Quest`
- The helper escapes brackets: `str.replace(/\[/g, '\\[').replace(/\]/g, '\\]')`

### Data Model

**Skills** (`js/data/skills.js`):
- 5 tiers: literacy, product, foundation, core, specialization
- Each skill has id, name, tier, description
- Weapon profiles (dagger → trident) based on T-shape progress

**Questions** (`js/data/questions.js`):
- Keyed by skill ID, then by level (1-7)
- Format: `{ q: "question", options: ["a", "b", "c", "d"], correct: 2, explanation: "...", learnMore: {...} }`
- **Runtime shuffling**: Options are shuffled when displayed, so `correct` position in file doesn't affect gameplay
- Fields:
  - `q`: Question text
  - `options`: Array of 4 answer choices (all similar length and plausibility)
  - `correct`: Index (0-3) of correct answer - vary across questions for maintainability
  - `explanation`: Why the answer is correct (shown after answering)
  - `learnMore`: Object with `url` and `text` for tutorial link (highly recommended)
- Helper functions: `getQuestionsForSkill()`, `getAvailableLevels()`, `hasQuestions()`
- Minimum questions per level: L1-2: 3, L3-4: 4, L5: 5, L6-7: 6

**Skill Levels** (`js/data/skills.js`):
- Level 1: Aware (blue) - 100 XP
- Level 2: Competent (green) - 300 XP
- Level 3: Proficient (yellow) - 600 XP
- Level 4: Advanced (orange) - 1000 XP
- Level 5: Expert (purple) - 1500 XP
- Level 6: Master (pink) - 2100 XP ⭐ Advanced
- Level 7: Grandmaster (teal) - 2800 XP ⭐ Advanced

**Advanced Levels (6-7):**
- Available only for selected foundation skills and all specialization skills
- Visual indicators: Star badge (⭐) on skills with advanced levels in skill tree
- Pink/teal button colors for level 6-7 in skill detail scene
- Topics cover latest features and advanced concepts (2025-2026 documentation)

**State** (`js/utils/storage.js`):
- Stored in localStorage under key `waldur-quest`
- Tracks: totalXP, skillProgress, achievements, currentProfile, stats
- Key functions: `loadState()`, `saveState()`, `updateSkillProgress()`, `getStats()`, `resetProgress()`

### Game Flow
1. **Menu** → shows player profile, stats, and help button (?)
2. **Skill Tree** → browse skills by tier, T-shape progress panel with recommendations on right
3. **Skill Detail** → choose difficulty level, see skill description
4. **Quiz** → 5 questions with number hints (1-4), exit button, keyboard controls
5. **Results** → XP calculation, "Next Level" button if passed, or "Try Again" if failed

### UI Features

**Menu Scene:**
- Help overlay (?) explains game rules, T-shape concept, XP system, controls
- Click outside or press ESC to close overlays

**Skill Tree Scene:**
- Right panel shows T-shape progress (breadth bars + depth count)
- Visual T-shape indicator grows based on progress
- "Recommended Next" section suggests skills to improve T-shape
- Recommendations prioritize: literacy gaps → foundation gaps → specialization depth → level up existing
- Skills with advanced levels (6-7) show a pink ⭐ badge in the upper right corner

**Quiz Scene:**
- Exit button (✕) to return to skill tree without finishing
- Number badges (1-4) on each answer option
- Keyboard hint footer: "Press 1-4 to answer • Space/Enter for next"
- Answer with mouse click or keyboard 1-4
- After answering, shows explanation (if available) with "Learn More" link to tutorials
- Next question with Enter/Space or click Next button

**Results Scene:**
- "Next Level →" button appears when quiz passed (60%+) and not at max level for that skill
- Max level is dynamic per skill (5 for most skills, 6-7 for skills with advanced levels)
- "Try Again" button appears when quiz failed
- Always shows "Skill Tree" and "Main Menu" options

**Profile Scene:**
- "Reset Progress" button with confirmation dialog
- Shows stats, weapon profile, and tier progress bars

## Adding New Questions

Add to `js/data/questions.js` under the appropriate skill ID and level:
```javascript
'skill-id': {
    1: [
        {
            q: "What does the 'docker ps' command display?",
            options: [
                "A list of all available Docker images on the system",
                "Docker daemon process and memory statistics",
                "A list of currently running containers",
                "Configuration of Docker networks and volumes"
            ],
            correct: 2,
            explanation: "The 'docker ps' command lists running containers. Use 'docker ps -a' to see all containers including stopped ones.",
            learnMore: {
                url: "https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/",
                text: "📚 Docker ps Reference"
            }
        }
    ],  // min 3 questions per level 1-2
    // ... levels 3-4: min 4 questions, level 5: min 5 questions
    // ... levels 6-7 (advanced): min 6 questions each
}
```

**Note:** Options are shuffled at runtime, so the `correct` index position in the file doesn't affect gameplay. Vary positions (0-3) across questions for easier code review.

**Skills with Advanced Levels (6-7):**
- Foundation: f-docker, f-git, f-ci-cd, f-linux, f-sql, f-testing
- Specialization: All 8 skills (s-kubernetes, s-ansible, s-openstack, s-azure, s-slurm, s-oidc, s-monitoring, s-gitlab-cicd)

### Question Writing Rules

**CRITICAL: All answer options must be plausible and similar in style:**
- All 4 options should be similar in length (don't make wrong answers obviously shorter)
- Most wrong answers should be believable - things a learner might actually think
- Occasional joke/absurd answers are fine for fun, but use sparingly (max 1 per question)
- The correct answer should NOT be obvious just by being longer or more detailed

**Good example:**
```javascript
{
    q: "What does the 'docker ps' command display?",
    options: [
        "A list of all available Docker images on the system",
        "Docker daemon process and memory usage statistics",
        "A list of currently running containers",
        "Configuration of Docker networks and volumes"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "The 'docker ps' command lists running containers.",
    learnMore: { url: "https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/", text: "📚 Docker Docs" }
}
```

**Bad example (wrong answers too short/obvious):**
```javascript
{
    q: "What does 'docker ps' show?",
    options: [
        "A complete list of all currently running Docker containers",  // Correct but much longer
        "Images",           // Too short
        "Nothing",          // Absurd
        "Errors"            // Too vague
    ],
    correct: 0  // Always position 0 is also a pattern to avoid
}
```

**Other guidelines:**
- `explanation` is required - helps users learn from mistakes
- `learnMore` URL is highly recommended - link to official docs, not blog posts
- All 4 options must be similar length (±20% character count)
- Higher levels should have harder questions
- Each quiz pulls 5 random questions from the level
- Vary `correct` position (0-3) across questions for code maintainability

## Adding New Skills

1. Add skill object to `skills` array in `js/data/skills.js`
2. Add corresponding questions in `js/data/questions.js`
3. Skills without questions are hidden from the skill tree

## T-Shape Developer Concept

- **Breadth**: Literacy (80%) + Foundation (50%) tiers form the horizontal bar
- **Depth**: Specialization skills at level 4+ form vertical spikes
- **Weapon profiles** evolve based on T-shape:
  - Dagger: Starting
  - Shield: Breadth complete (80% literacy, 50% foundation)
  - Spear: Any specialization at expert level
  - Lance: Shield + 1 specialization
  - Bident: Shield + 2 specializations
  - Trident: Shield + 3 specializations
